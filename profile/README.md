This is a free-time project. We'd like to create a completely open-source and free (as in freedom) device management system. 
Many of the popular tools in the industry are *very* expensive and often unaffordable, especially for smaller
businesses. Besides cost, many of those tools require a permanent internet connection and rely on a cloud provider.

**The main aims of this project therefore are:**

- open-source and free (code-wise and money-wise)
- always self-hosted (no cloud providers, no big brother who's watching)
- capable of working offline / in a local network only
- able to run on windows and linux
